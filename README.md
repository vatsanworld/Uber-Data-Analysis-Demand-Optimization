# Uber-Data-Analysis-Demand-Optimization
Uber trip dataset analyzed using Python to explore duration trends, peak hours, and travel behavior through data cleaning and visualizations.

This project delivers data-driven insights for Uber rides focused on understanding demand patterns, hotspot clusters, trip purpose behavior, and insights on other opportunities. The objective is to translate raw trip data into actionable recommendations that improve **fleet allocation**, **customer experience**, and **revenue optimization**.

---

## Project Objective
To analyze temporal and spatial demand patterns and evaluate efficiency metrics to guide:
- Optimal driver allocation and resource balancing
- Hotspot, Time period, and purpose-based business prioritization
- Revenue improvement opportunities

---

## Key Business Insights
- **Evening and Weekend demand peaks dominate traffic**, emphasizing strong leisure and social travel patterns.
- **Short-distance congested rides significantly reduce revenue efficiency**, suggesting dispatch or pricing optimization potential.
- **Medium-length trips generate the highest revenue per minute**, representing high-value target segments for fleet allocation.
- **Corporate-purpose travel outperforms personal usage in efficiency**, indicating growth opportunities via enterprise travel programs.
- **Demand clusters are concentrated around specific hotspot routes**, supporting geo-intelligent supply planning.

## Dashboards (Tableau)
The analysis is delivered through three dashboards:

| Dashboard | Focus |
|-----------|--------|
| **Executive Overview** | High-level trip KPIs & segmentation |
| **Operational Demand & Hotspot Intelligence** | Demand heatmap (Day × Time), Top Hotspots, Trip Purpose |

*Tableau packaged workbook (.twbx) and dashboard images included in repository.*

## Featured Visuals
- Temporal Heatmap (Day × Time Period)
- Top 10 Hotspots (Pickup location demand ranking)
- Trips by Time Period (operational cycles)
- Business vs Personal segmentation (Pie)
- Top 5 Purposes
